Globetrotter is a travel planner web application designed to help users explore destinations and organize travel plans. The project is built with a focus on clean structure, modular files, and modern web development practices.

The application uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, with Supabase integrated as the backend service for data storage and user authentication. This allows Globetrotter to support persistent data, multi-user access, and scalable growth beyond a static website.

The repository contains multiple HTML files representing different pages of the application, along with corresponding CSS files for layout and styling. JavaScript files handle client-side logic, user interactions, and communication with Supabase. The codebase is organized to keep structure, styles, and behavior clearly separated.

Globetrotter currently supports core frontend functionality and is structured to allow future expansion, such as enhanced trip planning features, real-time updates, and improved user experience.

Technologies used in this project include HTML5 for markup, CSS3 for styling, JavaScript (ES6+) for interactivity and logic, and Supabase for database management, authentication, and API access.

To run the project locally, clone the repository and open the main HTML file in a browser or serve the project using a local development server. Supabase credentials must be configured in the JavaScript files for full functionality.

This project is intended for educational and portfolio purposes and demonstrates the integration of a frontend web application with a backend-as-a-service platform.
